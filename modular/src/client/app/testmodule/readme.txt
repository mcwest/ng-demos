The code in this directory, combined with other changes in this same commit, create a new service as described in the
'Modules, Debugging Module Errors' section of the current version of John Papa's class. This solution differs from the solution 
that would be needed for the course code, since the course code did not use $inject to inject the new service, instead it passed 
it as an argument to the module().controller method. 

The service code was generated using the current version of John Papa's WebStorm file templates from
http://jpapa.me/ngstormtmpl
